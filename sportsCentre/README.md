### Why Blueprint?  
Reading Link: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/
## A blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code into a single unit. 
## Blueprints can be registered with an application, and then those views and other code can be accessed through URLs in the application.

Some benefits of using blueprints in Flask include:

    1.Modular code organization: Blueprints allow you to group related functionality together in a single module, making it easier to organize and maintain your code.

    2. Reusability: Blueprints can be used across multiple Flask applications, making it easy to reuse code in different projects.

    3. URL prefixing: Blueprints can be used to prefix all of the URLs associated with a group of views, making it easy to create sub-applications within a larger Flask application.

    4. Namespace collision avoidance: Blueprints can help avoid naming collisions between views and other code in a larger Flask application, by grouping related functionality into separate namespaces.

Overall, using blueprints in Flask can help make your code more modular, reusable, and organized, which can make it easier to develop and maintain Flask applications over time.
